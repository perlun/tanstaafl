	* editor.cc (edit_message): Made a nicify function to reflow quoted
	text, and also started rewriting parts of the editor with
	"undocumented features". :-)

	* keyboard_linux.cc: made the keyboard routines treat Alt and AltGr
	differently.
	* screen_linux.cc and screen_ncurses.cc: optimized the screen output
	so that the output buffer is just flushed when necessary. This makes
	especially the ncurses version a *lot* quicker.

	* reader.cc (choose_area): Quick-selection of area is now possible.
 	Just start typing the area tag, and the area selector will match it
	with the area you're requesting.

	* src/editor.cc: Rewrote parts of the editor in a much more optimized
	way, which makes it quite smoother when running in high resolutions.
	It is not complete yet, but will be as soon as I (or someone else
	has got the time).

	* src/misc.cc: The regexp searching for reply string has been
 	converted to "basic" format (i.e. POSIX) so it'll work in the DOS
	version too. It doesn't seem to work very well yet, though. :-/
	I could use some help with this, since I'm not very experienced
	with regular expressions.

	* First official version (0.0.2) almost released.
