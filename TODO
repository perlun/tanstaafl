This is a list of features to implement in some future version of tanstaafl.
The version number says in which version they probably will be done.
in no special order:

0.0.5
=====
* Fast "right arrow at end of area" (should be rewritten totally).
* Make replying of messages with lines above 80 columns work.
* Sort the packets by date when tossing, so we don't screw things up.

0.0.6
=====
* Search function, like in timEd.
* Undelete function in the editor.
* Color highlighting of *bold*, _underlined_ and /italic/ text.
* Rewrite libui to support multicolor strings (not really something that should
be done in tanstaafl, but WTF..).
* Copy and move messages to a selected area.
* Support for dead keys in the Linux console version. (also a libui thingie)

0.1.0
=====
* Support for external archivers.
* An ability to select between only the areas in which there are new messages.
* EMSI-capable mailer.
* binkp mailer. (30% done)
* User-definable origins for every single area.
* Random origins.
* Personal mail area.
* User-definable macros when writing netmail.
* Nodelist support.

If you feel something is missing, feel free to send a netmail to Per Lundberg
at 2:206/145.2000 or an E-mail to plundis@debian.org, and I'll take it under
consideration. Patches are of course also welcome, but please state clearly
what they're supposed to do.
